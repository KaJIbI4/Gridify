## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please create an issue on GitHub. We recommend providing as much detail as possible about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce the issue and potential impact.

### Reporting Guidelines

- **Where to Report:** Create an issue on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/alirezanet/Gridify/issues).
- **Expected Response Time:** We aim to respond to vulnerability reports within 72 hours.
- **After Reporting:** Once a vulnerability is reported, we will acknowledge the report and provide regular updates until the issue is resolved. If the vulnerability is accepted, it will be prioritized and patched in a timely manner. If declined, we will provide a clear reason for the decision.

Please do not disclose any security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed.

Thank you for helping to keep our project secure!
